This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying board game rule documents. It leverages **ChromaDB** for embedding and document retrieval and the **Gemini Flash API** to generate comprehensive, human-like answers.\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project performs the following steps:\n\n1. **Indexing:**  \n   Index board game rule documents (with metadata) into a ChromaDB collection using the Gemini Flash embedding API in `retrieval_document` mode.\n\n2. **Retrieval:**  \n   Given a user query, retrieve multiple relevant passages from the ChromaDB collection by switching to `retrieval_query` mode.\n\n3. **Generation:**  \n   Combine the retrieved passages with the user query into an enhanced prompt (including few-shot examples) and generate an answer using the Gemini Flash API. An iterative feedback loop refines the answer for clarity and detail.\n\n4. **Interactive Interface:**  \n   Use **ipywidgets** to build an interactive Q&A interface directly in your Jupyter Notebook for live querying and answer generation.\n\n5. **Caching & Modular Enhancements:**  \n   Utilize an LRU cache to reduce redundant API calls for repeated prompts.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip uninstall -qqy jupyterlab kfp \n!pip install -qU \"google-genai==1.7.0\" \"chromadb==0.6.3\"\n!pip install streamlit\n!pip install

Use the few-shot examples as guidance for clarity and detail.\n\nFew-shot Examples:\nExample 1:\nQ: How do players start the game?\nA: Each player begins with a fixed amount of gold and units, and the game commences with turn-based actions.\n\nExample 2:\nQ: What happens if an opponent's territory is occupied?\nA: If a player occupies an opponent's territory for two consecutive turns, control is lost.\n\nQUESTION: How do players initiate the game setup?\n\nPASSAGES:\nEmpire Builders Rules - Document 1: Setup: Each player starts with 100 gold and 5 units. Objective: Conquer territories on a hexagonal map. Turn order: Players alternate turns, beginning with the youngest player.\nEmpire Builders Rules - Document 2: Movement & Combat: In your turn, you can move units up to 3 spaces. Combat is resolved by comparing unit strengths, with some randomness. Special mechanics enhance conflict dynamics.\nEmpire Builders Advanced Tactics: Advanced players use formation strategies and resource allocation to outmaneuver opponents.\n\nAnswer:\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# %% [markdown]\n# ## Iterative Feedback Loop\n# We simulate an extra refinement step where the initial answer is improved for clarity and completeness.","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-15T00:35:24.443482Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-15T00:35:24.443828Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-15T00:35:24.448023Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-15T00:35:24.443801Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-15T00:35:24.447228Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":22},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def generate_answer(prompt_text):\n    \"\"\"Generate an answer from the Gemini Flash model using the actual API call.\"\"\"\n    response = client.models.generate_content(\n         model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",  # Use your desired Gemini Flash model version.\n         contents=prompt_text\n    )\n    return response.text\n\n# Generate the initial answer using an enhanced prompt (generation_prompt defined earlier).\ninitial_answer = generate_answer(generation_prompt)\nprint(\"Initial Answer:\\n\", initial_answer)\n\ndef refine_answer(initial_answer, query, passages):\n    \"\"\"\n    Refine the initial answer using the Gemini Flash API.\n    This function creates a refinement prompt that instructs the model to review and improve the initial response.\n    \"\"\"\n    refinement_prompt = (\n        \"Review the following answer and refine it so that it is more clear, detailed, \"\n        \"and accessible to a non-technical audience.

These units will be used to explore the map, claim territories, and engage in combat with other players.\n\nThe game is played on a hexagonal map where players try to conquer territories.
