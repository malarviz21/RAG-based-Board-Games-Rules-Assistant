I’ve built a little simple AI helper for board‑game fans: you feed it any set of rulebooks (even different editions), and it quietly tucks them away in a smart database. When you have a question “How do I set up?” or “What changed in the new edition?” it pulls the right passages and uses Gemini Flash to explain everything in everyday language. You can even ask it for simple strategy tips based on the current game state. And the coolest part? You don’t need a separate app, everything runs interactively right in your notebook like a friendly teammate who always knows the rules.
